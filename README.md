## 📚 Topics Covered
- ☕ [Java (OOP)](./Java/)
- 🛢️ [MySQL](./MySql/)
- 🌐 [JavaScript](./JavaScript/)
- 🟢 [Node.js](./Node.js/)
- ⚛️ [React.js](./React.js/)
- 🐹 [Golang](./Golang/)
- 📡 [REST API](./REST-API/)
- 🧩 [Design Patterns](./Design-Patterns/)
- 🤖 [Machine Learning (Computer Vision)](./ML/)

## 💡 My Observations on the Interview Process
### 🎯 Must-Haves:
- 🧠 <b>Problem Solving Skills:</b> Practice makes perfect! Expect Leetcode easy to medium-level problems. For instance, in BS23, we were given 9 competitive programming questions and 20 MCQs to solve within 2 hours.
- 🗄️ <b>Solid MySQL Knowledge:</b> Be ready for direct/similar SQL queries, especially those from Leetcode. This [Leetcode SQL Questions list](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/) is a great resource!
- 🔧 Strong OOP Concepts: Essential for companies like DSI, Orbitx, Brain Station 23, etc. However, don't be surprised if some interviews skip OOP entirely!
- 💬 <b>Excellent Communication Skills:</b> Conversation is key, especially fluency in English. It can often make or break your chances. During my HR interview at Brainstation, we were asked to discuss current affairs in English to check our fluency and communication skills.

### 🌟 Good to Have:
- 🤝 <b>Strong Network with Seniors:</b> Referrals are invaluable! Without them,  even an interview call can be tough. Networking on LinkedIn and asking for referrals can open doors. (It’s better to search for internships on your own rather than wasting time and panicking at the last minute)
- 📁 <b>Showcase Projects in:</b> NLP, Flutter, DotNet, SpringBoot, etc. Having these projects can make you a versatile candidate, appealing to companies looking for specific skills. (The job market for DotNet and SpringBoot is huge in Bangladesh!)
