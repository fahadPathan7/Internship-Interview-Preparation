## My observations on the interview process:

### Must Have:
- **Problem solving skill**: Mostly leetcode easy and medium level questions. In BS23, we were given 9 cp questions and 20 mcqs to solve in 2h.
- **Good understanding of MySQL**: May get direct question from Leetcode SQL questions. This list will help a lot: [Leetcode SQL Questions](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/).
- **OOP**: OOP is a must for companies like: Dsi, Orbitx, Brain Station 23, etc. But some companies may not even ask a single question on OOP!
- **Conversation skill**: Conversation is the key. English fluency is a must for most of the companies. With your good conversation skill, you can get chance even if you suffer in technical skills. During HR viva in Brainstation, they asked us to talk randomly about current affairs in English so that they can understand our English fluency and coversation skill.

### Good to have:
- **Good relation with seniors**: If you want to get an internship by yourself, it is a must. Without referral, it is almost impossible to get an interview call! You may need to manage seniors on linkedin and ask for referral. (if you are an unlucky person, you may need to manage your internship by yourself :p)
- **At least a project on**: NLP, Flutter, DotNet, SpringBoot etc. It will make you flexible and fit for all companies. Some companies may recruit for specific team. So they may ask for specific skills. (job field of DotNet, SpringBoot is huge in Bangladesh)
